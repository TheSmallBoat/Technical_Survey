Gossamer: A Go implementation of the Polkadot Host (WIP)

Gossamer is an implementation of the Polkadot Host - a blockchain framework used to build and run nodes for different blockchain protocols within the Polkadot ecosystem.

Gossamer includes node implementations for major blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem and makes building node implementations for other blockchains trivial; blockchains built with Substrate can plug their compiled runtime into Gossamer to create a node implementation in Go.

Scalable collective authority

The collective authority (cothority) project provides a framework for development, analysis, and deployment of decentralized, distributed (cryptographic) protocols. A given set of servers running these protocols is referred to as a collective authority or cothority. Individual servers are called cothority servers or conodes. The code in this repository allows you to access the services of a cothority and/or run your own conode. The cothority project is developed and maintained by the DEDIS lab at EPFL.

Overlay Network for distributed protocols
The Cothority Overlay Network Library - Onet

The Overlay-network (Onet) is a library for simulation and deployment of decentralized, distributed protocols. This library offers a framework for research, simulation, and deployment of crypto-related protocols with an emphasis on decentralized, distributed protocols. It offers an abstraction for tree-based communications between thousands of nodes and it is used both in research for testing out new protocols and running simulations, as well as in production to deploy those protocols as a service in a distributed manner.

Onet is developed by DEDIS/EFPL as part of the Cothority project that aims to deploy a large number of nodes for distributed signing and related projects. In cothority, nodes are commonly named "conodes". A collective authority (cothority) is a set of conodes that work together to handle a distributed, decentralized task.

PriFi, a low-latency, local-area anonymous communication network. https://prifi.net

This repository implements PriFi, an anonymous communication protocol with provable traffic-analysis resistance and small latency suitable for wireless networks. PriFi provides a network access mechanism for protecting members of an organization who access the Internet while on-site (via privacy-preserving WiFi networking) and while off-site (via privacy-preserving virtual private networking or VPN). The small latency cost is achieved by leveraging the client-relay-server topology common in WiFi networks. The main entities of PriFi are: relay, trustee server (or Trustees), and clients. These collaborate to implement a Dining Cryptographer's network (DC-nets) that can anonymize the client upstream traffic. The relay is a WiFi router that can process normal TCP/IP traffic in addition to running our protocol.

SimNet is a tool to simulate decentralized applications in the cloud

SimNet is a tool to simulate a decentralized application using the cloud to host the simulation nodes. It provides multiple configurations to affect the topology so that specific link between two nodes can have a delay or a loss of packets for instance.
