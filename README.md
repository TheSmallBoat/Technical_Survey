# Technical Survey

## [Infrastructure]

### 01. Needing to read the code and understand its operating principle, as the source of inspiration for architectural design.

Connect, secure, control, and observe services. https://istio.io

https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2 
A service mesh for Kubernetes and beyond. Main repo for Linkerd 2.x.

### 02. Needing to read the code and understand its detail, as the base of refactoring code.


## [Decentralized VPN]

### 01. Needing to read the code and understand its operating principle, as the source of inspiration for architectural design.

https://github.com/meshbird/meshbird 
Meshbird is open-source cloud-native multi-region multi-cloud distributed private networking.

https://github.com/mehrdadrad/radvpn 
The RadVPN doesn't need any central point as it connects to other nodes directly (full mesh) it has built-in router that helps packets to route to the approperate destinations. there are two options for configuration: yaml file and if you want to have central configuration management it supports etcd. for the time being it supports symmetric encryptions and Linux platform.

https://github.com/kanocz/lcvpn 
Light decentralized VPN in golang

## [Component or library]

### 01. Needing to read the code and understand its operating principle, and use it as a component or library.
