https://github.com/meshbird/meshbird 
Meshbird is open-source cloud-native multi-region multi-cloud distributed private networking.

https://github.com/mehrdadrad/radvpn 
The RadVPN doesn't need any central point as it connects to other nodes directly (full mesh) it has built-in router that helps packets to route to the approperate destinations. there are two options for configuration: yaml file and if you want to have central configuration management it supports etcd. for the time being it supports symmetric encryptions and Linux platform.
