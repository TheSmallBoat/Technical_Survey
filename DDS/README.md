## About Kademlia-Implementation

The objective of this is to produce a working Distributed Data Store (DDS). In contrast to a traditional database, a DDS stores its data objects on many different computers rather than only one. These computers together make up a single storage network, which internally keeps track of what objects are stored and which nodes keep copies of them. The system will be able to store and locate data objects by their hashes in such a storage network, which is formed by many running instances of your system.
